*****  READ ME  *****

This version of the simulator can only be run using a specific tool that serves as a development environment for the program 
and is not intended to be used as such; for the reason that in the code it is necessary to set certain folder paths and it is 
necessary to have a compiler for Python 3.8.10 installed!!!

Please use the other publicly available version of the simulator!
