Before using the simulator, make sure you have Python 3.8.10 installed on your computer.

After you have downloaded the simulator, make sure to open the Stop_class.py and Train_class.py 
files in the "Scripts" folder and set the path in the constructor to the corresponding folders 
"Custom Stop" and "Real Trains" that are contained in the downloaded "Scripts" folder.

You can start the simulator, using a tool that serves as a development environment for programming, 
by running the Main_script.py.

If you want to run the simulator without a tool that serves as a development environment for programming, 
we suggest that you convert the python files into an executable file that will run the simulator.
