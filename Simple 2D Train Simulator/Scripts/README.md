Before using the simulator, make sure you have Python 3.8.10 installed on your computer.

After you have downloaded the simulator, open the Stop_class.py and Train_class.py files in 
the "Scripts" folder and set the path in the constructor to the corresponding folders in the 
downloaded "Images" folder.

You can start the simulator, using a tool that serves as a development environment for programming, 
by running the Main_script.py.

If you want to run the simulator without a tool that serves as a development environment for programming, 
we suggest that you convert the python files into an executable file that will run the simulator.
